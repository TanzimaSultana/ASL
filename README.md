## ASL Alphabet Recognition with Deep Learning & Transfer Learning ##

This project focuses on American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition using both machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) techniques.  It includes the implementation of custom CNN architectures and transfer learning using VGG16, as well as a live webcam-based ASL detection interface.

### Features
Classification of 29 ASL alphabet signs (A–Z, space, del, nothing)

Models implemented:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Custom CNN (with and without data augmentation)

VGG16-based Transfer Learning (frozen & fine-tuned)

GUI-based real-time webcam detection using Tkinter
